## Hey there, I'm Ely ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer that specializes in backend development. I love doing all that fun, nitty gritty, behind the scenes stuff.

## Example Work
### PHP
[MCProHosting's OneControlCenter](https://panel.mcprohosting.com/)  
I implemented most of the backend functionality of the control panel that manages thousands of minecraft serviers while utilizing the laravel framework.

### C#
I'm an avid fan of the .NET framework and love making ASP.NET websites or WPF applications.
