## Hey there, I'm Ely ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer that specializes in backend development. I love doing all that fun, nitty gritty, behind the scenes stuff.

### Why is there sudden reduced activity on your profile?
I'm making most of my changes on a private gitlab instance! My GitHub is not meant to be a measurement of my productivity or skills.

## Example Work
### PHP
[MCProHosting's OneControlCenter](https://panel.mcprohosting.com/)  
I implemented most of the backend functionality of the control panel that manages thousands of minecraft serviers while utilizing the laravel framework.

### C#
[Spectero Daemon](https://github.com/projectspectero/daemon)  
Spectero is a VPN marketplace company that allowed users to lease out their infrastuructre to compmanies looking to view webpages from different browsers aroud the world. I hoped contribute to their daemon development.
